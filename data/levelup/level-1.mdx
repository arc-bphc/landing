### LED

- PN Junction diode that emits light.
- Longer end is the anode (positive) and shorter end is cathode (negative)
- Usually Red Wire is connected to positive terminal and Black wire is connected to negative terminal.
- Voltage requirements : 1.2-3.6V

### Breadboard

- The place where you will be making all your connections.
- The holes of the breadboard are interconnected in a specific fashion which can be seen below :

### Jumper Cables

- To make connections on the breadboard we use jumper cables.
- We have male to male and male to female connectors.

### Resistor

- A resistor is a passive two-terminal electrical component that implements electrical resistance as a circuit element.

### Data Types

In programming a data type is simply an attribute of data which tells the compiler or interpreter how the programmer intends to use data.

- int - stores integer values.
- float - stores fractional values.
- double - same as float but higher precision.
- char - stores character's ASCII Value.
- bool - holds either true or false value

### Variables

In programming, a variable is a storage location associated with a name and is used to store value of a data type.
The syntax for declaring variable is as follows:
`data-type v1;`
where v1 is the name of variable.

```C++
int A = 5;
float B = 6.9;
double C = 7.23789;
bool D = true;
char E = 'A';
String F = "ARC is Love";
```

### Static and Constant Variables

- [Static Variables](https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/language/variables/variable-scope-qualifiers/static/)
- [Constant](https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/language/variables/variable-scope-qualifiers/const/)

### Operators

An operator in a programming language is a symbol that tells the compiler or interpreter to perform a specific mathematical, relational, or logical operation and produce final result.

Different types of operators

- Arithmetic operators
- Logical Operators
- Relational Operators

```C++
int a = 12, b =5;

int c = a + b; // c = 17
int d = a - b; // d = 7
int e = a * b; // e = 60
int f = a / b; // f = 2
int g = a % b; // g = 2 (Remainder)
```

### Hello World

Youâ€™re going to learn how to use Serial Monitor and Display a simple message on it.
The code on TinkerCAD will look something similar to this-

```c++
String message = "Welcome to Level Up by ARC";

void setup(){
	Serial.begin(9600); // Setup serial monitor with a baud rate of 9600 bits per second

	Serial.println(message); // Print message onto the serial monitor
}
```

Syntax -
**Serial.println(val, format)**

- val : Value to print
  val can be any data type
- format : Specifies base(for int type)
  or number of decimal places
  (for floating point type)

## Assignments

1. Print your intro on the Serial Monitor.
2. Swap the last two numbers of your ID. (Don't Hardcode swapped numbers).
3. An H-bridge is an electronic circuit that switches the polarity of a voltage applied to a load. These circuits are often used in robotics and other applications to allow DC motors to run forwards or backwards. Now you have to use 2 LEDs. 1st LED should glow in one configuration & 2nd LED should glow in other configuration of the H-bridge.
