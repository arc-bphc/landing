# Introduction to LINUX

At present, ROS is fully supported only by Linux systems. This means any ROS-based robot uses Linux, so if you want to create programs for these robots, you have to get ready with Linux.Linux tends to be a highly reliable and secure system than any other operating systems (OS). Linux and Unix-based OS have fewer security flaws, as the code is reviewed by a huge number of developers constantly

In the Linux for Robotics course, you will master essential Linux knowledge in order to get started with ROS.

## Setting Up Environment
You can choose any one of the three ways to configure your environment.Initially,you can use the Virtual Machine to run linux-based applications and later you could dual boot your system with Linux and Windows.
The third option of completely removing Windows and shifting to Linux completely is also present.But initially,it is advised to use any one of the first two methods. 

<!-- https://csabitsh.wordpress.com/linux-installation/ -->
### Dual boot Installation:
Switching to Linux can be a big decision, depending on how you use your computer. Sometimes, you just need Windows for specific applications, and sometimes you need Linux for other applications. Whether you are just curious or you need it for work or a personal project, having both operating systems on one computer can be useful.This article will help you [install Ubuntu 20.04 and dual boot alongside Windows 10.](https://medium.com/linuxforeveryone/how-to-install-ubuntu-20-04-and-dual-boot-alongside-windows-10-323a85271a73)

### Virtual Machine
To install Ubuntu on macOS, Linux or Windows, we can dual boot Ubuntu alongside any operating system. Instead of dual boot, a virtual machine is an alternate solution to install and test all new features of Ubuntu 20.04. So, let’s jump into the Ubuntu installation guide by creating a [Ubuntu virtual machine](https://fossbytes.com/how-to-install-ubuntu-20-04-lts-virtualbox-windows-mac-linux/)

### Ubuntu 20.04 -Removing Windows completely

### Troubleshooting Guidelines
will keep updating regularly.

### Bash script to install
After setting up the linux-installation,we will need to install things like python,vscode and other things.For that you can simply run this bash code in your terminal after cloning this repository.
[[bash script]](https://drive.google.com/file/d/11oqhEBpsZzGvKTNuk04gMUGYHiLP_SNa/view?usp=sharing)

After copying this file to your working folder,run the following commands in your terminal.
```
chmod +x linux-setup.sh
./linux-setup.sh
```

## OPENCV

OpenCV is an open Source package/library which is aimed at real time computer vision.It can be used for a variety of different applications including face detection, objection tracking, landmark detection, and much more.

### Applications of OpenCV:

- 2D and 3D feature toolkits
- Facial recognition system
- Gesture recognition
- Human-computer interaction
- Motion understanding
- Object identification

Initially, it might be difficult to explore all the variety of functions that the OpenCV library offers, but as you work on more OpenCV-based projects, you will get the hang of it.

## Getting started with images

### Importing libraries
```python
import cv2
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```

### Reading images using OpenCV
OpenCV allowa to read different format of images like PNG, JPG, etc. Image can be loaded in grayscal, color or using alpha channel. This uses `cv2.imread()` function.
The syntax of the function is:
`image = cv2.imread( filename , [flags])`

`image` is the required image if it loads successfully otherwise it's `None`
1. `filename`: This can be the absolute path or the relative path of the image. It is a mandatory argument.
2. `Flags`: These flags are use dto read image in a particular format.
	a. `cv2.IMREAD_GRAYSCALE` or `0`: Loads image in grayscale
	b. `cv2.IMREAD_COLOR` or `1`: Loads a color image.
	c. `cv2.UNCHANGED` or `-1`: Loads image including alpha channel

```python
# Read image as gray scale.
image = cv2.imread("checkerboard_18x18.png",0)

# Print the image data (pixel values), element of a 2D numpy array.
# Each pixel value is 8-bits [0,255]
print(image)
```

### Display images using Matplotlib
```python
# Display image.
plt.imshow(image)
```
<Image 
  src="static/images/levelup/level-6/o1.png" 
  alt="Data Types" 
  width='auto' 
  height='auto'
/>

**What happened?**
Even though the image was read in as a gray scale image, it won't necessarily display in gray scale when using imshow(). matplotlib uses different color maps and it's possible that the gray scale color map is not set.
```python
# Set color map to gray scale for proper rendering.
plt.imshow(cb_img, cmap='gray')
```
<Image 
  src="static/images/levelup/level-6/o2.png" 
  alt="Data Types" 
  width='auto' 
  height='auto'
/>

### Working with Color Images
Until now, we have been using gray scale images in our discussion. Let us now discuss color images.
```python
# Read in image
coke_img = cv2.imread("coca-cola-logo.png",1)
plt.imshow(coke_img)
```

<Image 
  src="static/images/levelup/level-6/o3.png" 
  alt="Data Types" 
  width='auto' 
  height='auto'
/>

**Huhh! This isn't what we expected?**
The color displayed above is different from the actual image. This is because matplotlib expects the image in RGB format whereas OpenCV stores images in BGR format. Thus, for correct display, we need to reverse the channels of the image. We will discuss about the channels in the sections below.
```python
coke_img_channels_reversed = coke_img[:, :, ::-1]
plt.imshow(coke_img_channels_reversed)
```

<Image 
  src="static/images/levelup/level-6/o4.png" 
  alt="Data Types" 
  width='auto' 
  height='auto'
/>

### Splitting Color Channels
`cv2.split()` Divides a multi-channel array into several single-channel arrays.

```python
# Split the image into the B,G,R components
img_NZ_bgr = cv2.imread("New_Zealand_Lake.jpg",cv2.IMREAD_COLOR)
b,g,r = cv2.split(img_NZ_bgr)

# Show the channels
plt.figure(figsize=[20,5])
plt.subplot(141);plt.imshow(r,cmap='gray');plt.title("Red Channel");
plt.subplot(142);plt.imshow(g,cmap='gray');plt.title("Green Channel");
plt.subplot(143);plt.imshow(b,cmap='gray');plt.title("Blue Channel");

# Merge the individual channels into a BGR image
imgMerged = cv2.merge((b,g,r))
# Show the merged output
plt.subplot(144);plt.imshow(imgMerged[:,:,::-1]);plt.title("Merged Output");
```

<Image 
  src="static/images/levelup/level-6/o5.png" 
  alt="Data Types" 
  width='auto' 
  height='auto'
/>

### Converting to different Color Spaces
`cv2.cvtColor()` Converts an image from one color space to another. The function converts an input image from one color space to another. In case of a transformation to-from RGB color space, the order of the channels should be specified explicitly (RGB or BGR).

**Function syntax**:
`image = cv2.cvtColor( src, code )`
The function has 2 required arguments:

1. `src` input image
2. `code` color space conversion code (see ColorConversionCodes).

**OpenCV Documentation**
`cv2.cvtColor()`:[https://docs.opencv.org/3.4/d8/d01/group__imgproc__color__conversions.html#ga397ae87e1288a81d2363b61574eb8cab](https://docs.opencv.org/3.4/d8/d01/group__imgproc__color__conversions.html#ga397ae87e1288a81d2363b61574eb8cab)

```python
# OpenCV stores color channels in a differnet order than most other applications (BGR vs RGB).
image = cv2.cvtColor(img_NZ_bgr, cv2.COLOR_BGR2RGB)
plt.imshow(image)
```


## Accessing the camera

```python
import cv2

video = cv2.VideoCapture(0)
video.set(3,640)
video.set(4,480)
video.set(10,100)

while(True):
    success, img = video.read()
    cv2.imshow("Video",img)
    if cv2.waitKey(1) & 0xFF ==ord('q'):
        break

source.release()
cv2.destroyWindow(win_name)
```

## Basic Image manipulation
```python
import cv2
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from PIL import Image
```

**Original image**
```python
# Read image as gray scale.
cb_img = cv2.imread("checkerboard_18x18.png",0)

# Set color map to gray scale for proper rendering.
plt.imshow(cb_img, cmap='gray')
print(cb_img)
```
### Accessing individual pixels
For accessing any pixel in a numpy matrix, you have to use matrix notation such as matrix[r,c], where the r is the row number and c is the column number. Also note that the matrix is 0-indexed.

```python
# print the first pixel of the first black box
print(cb_img[0,0])
# print the first white pixel to the right of the first black box
print(cb_img[0,6])
```

### Cropping images
Cropping an image is simply achieved by selecting a specific (pixel) region of the image.

```python
cropped_region = img_NZ_rgb[200:400, 300:600]
plt.imshow(cropped_region)
```

**Before**
<Image 
  src="static/images/levelup/level-6/o6.png" 
  alt="Data Types" 
  width='auto' 
  height='auto'
/>

**After**
<Image 
  src="static/images/levelup/level-6/o7.png" 
  alt="Data Types" 
  width='auto' 
  height='auto'
/>

### Resizing images
The function `resize` resizes the image `src` down to or up to the specified size. The size and type are derived from the `src`,`dsize`,`fx`, and `fy`.

```python
resized_cropped_region_2x = cv2.resize(image,None,fx=2, fy=2)
plt.imshow(resized_cropped_region_2x)
```

### Flipping images
The function `flip` flips the array in one of three different ways (row and column indices are 0-based):

**Function Syntax**
`dst = cv.flip( src, flipCode )`

`flipCode`: a flag to specify how to flip the array; 0 means flipping around the x-axis and positive value (for example, 1) means flipping around y-axis. Negative value (for example, -1) means flipping around both axes.

```python
img_NZ_rgb_flipped_horz = cv2.flip(img_NZ_rgb, 1)
img_NZ_rgb_flipped_vert = cv2.flip(img_NZ_rgb, 0)
img_NZ_rgb_flipped_both = cv2.flip(img_NZ_rgb, -1)

# Show the images
plt.figure(figsize=[18,5])
plt.subplot(141);plt.imshow(img_NZ_rgb_flipped_horz);plt.title("Horizontal Flip");
plt.subplot(142);plt.imshow(img_NZ_rgb_flipped_vert);plt.title("Vertical Flip");
plt.subplot(143);plt.imshow(img_NZ_rgb_flipped_both);plt.title("Both Flipped");
plt.subplot(144);plt.imshow(img_NZ_rgb);plt.title("Original");
```

## Image Annotation

### Drawing a Line
We will use cv2.line function for this.

**Function Syntax**
`img = cv2.line(img, pt1, pt2, color, thickness, lineType, shift)`
**Example**
```python
cv2.line(image, (200, 100), (400, 100), (0, 255, 255), thickness=5, lineType=cv2.LINE_AA);
```

<Image 
  src="static/images/levelup/level-6/o9.png" 
  alt="Data Types" 
  width='auto' 
  height='auto'
/>

### Drawing a Circle
We will use cv2.circle function for this.

**Function Syntax**
`img = cv2.circle(img, center, radius, color, thickness, lineType, shift)`
**Example**
```python
cv2.circle(image, (900,500), 100, (0, 0, 255), thickness=5, lineType=cv2.LINE_AA);

```

<Image 
  src="static/images/levelup/level-6/o10.png" 
  alt="Data Types" 
  width='auto'
  height='auto'
/>

### Drawing a Rectangle

We will use cv2.rectangle function to draw a rectangle on an image.

**Function Syntax**
`img = cv2.rectangle(img, pt1, pt2, color, thickness, lineType, shift)`
**Example**
```python
cv2.rectangle(image, (500, 100), (700,600), (255, 0, 255), thickness=5, lineType=cv2.LINE_8);

```

<Image 
  src="static/images/levelup/level-6/o11.png" 
  alt="Data Types" 
  width='auto' 
  height='auto' 
/>

### Adding Text
Finally, let's see how we can write some text on an image using cv2.putText function.

**Function Syntax**
`img = cv2.putText(img, text, org, fontFace, fontScale, color, thickness, lineType, bottomLeftOrigin)`
**Example**
```python
cv2.putText(imageText, text, (200, 700), fontFace, fontScale, fontColor, fontThickness, cv2.LINE_AA);

```

<Image 
  src="static/images/levelup/level-6/o12.png" 
  alt="Data Types" 
  width='auto' 
  height='auto'
/>

## Image Enhancement

### Changing brightness
The first operation we discuss is simple addition of images. This results in increasing or decreasing the brightness of the image since we are eventually increasing or decreasing the intensity values of each pixel by the same amount. So, this will result in a global increase/decrease in brightness.

```python
matrix = np.ones(img_rgb.shape, dtype = "uint8") * 50

img_rgb_brighter = cv2.add(img_rgb, matrix)
img_rgb_darker   = cv2.subtract(img_rgb, matrix)
```

<Image 
  src="static/images/levelup/level-6/o13.png" 
  alt="Data Types" 
  width='auto' 
  height='auto'
/>


### Changing contrast

Contrast is the difference in the intensity values of the pixels of an image. Multiplying the intensity values with a constant can make the difference larger or smaller ( if multiplying factor is < 1 ).

```python
matrix1 = np.ones(img_rgb.shape) * .8
matrix2 = np.ones(img_rgb.shape) * 1.2

img_rgb_darker   = np.uint8(cv2.multiply(np.float64(img_rgb), matrix1))
img_rgb_brighter = np.uint8(cv2.multiply(np.float64(img_rgb), matrix2))
```

<Image 
  src="static/images/levelup/level-6/o14.png" 
  alt="Data Types" 
  width='auto' 
  height='auto'
/>

**What happened?**
Can you see the weird colors in some areas of the image after multiplication?

The issue is that after multiplying, the values which are already high, are becoming greater than 255. Thus, the overflow issue. How do we overcome this?
`img_rgb_higher  = np.uint8(np.clip(cv2.multiply(np.float64(img_rgb), matrix2),0,255))`


### Image thresholding

Binary Images have a lot of use cases in Image Processing. One of the most common use cases is that of creating masks. Image Masks allow us to process on specific parts of an image keeping the other parts intact. Image Thresholding is used to create Binary Images from grayscale images. You can use different thresholds to create different binary images from the same original image.

**Function Syntax** 
`retval, dst = cv2.threshold( src, thresh, maxval, type[, dst] )`
`dst`: The output array of the same size and type and the same number of channels as src.

The function has 4 required arguments:

`src`: input array image
`thresh`: threshold value.
`maxval`: maximum value to use with the THRESH_BINARY and THRESH_BINARY_INV thresholding types.
`type`: thresholding type (see [ThresholdTypes](https://docs.opencv.org/4.5.1/d7/d1b/group__imgproc__misc.html#gaa9e58d2860d4afa658ef70a9b1115576)).

```python
img_read = cv2.imread("building-windows.jpg", cv2.IMREAD_GRAYSCALE)
retval, img_thresh = cv2.threshold(img_read, 100, 255, cv2.THRESH_BINARY)

# Show the images
plt.figure(figsize=[18,5])
plt.subplot(121); plt.imshow(img_read, cmap="gray");         plt.title("Original");
plt.subplot(122); plt.imshow(img_thresh, cmap="gray");       plt.title("Thresholded");

print(img_thresh.shape)
```

### BITWISE operations

Example API for `cv2.bitwise_and()`. Others include: `cv2.bitwise_or()`, `cv2.bitwise_xor()`, `cv2.bitwise_not()`

```python
img_rec = cv2.imread("rectangle.jpg", cv2.IMREAD_GRAYSCALE)

img_cir = cv2.imread("circle.jpg", cv2.IMREAD_GRAYSCALE)

plt.figure(figsize=[20,5])
plt.subplot(121);plt.imshow(img_rec,cmap='gray')
plt.subplot(122);plt.imshow(img_cir,cmap='gray')
print(img_rec.shape)
```
