## Aim
To create a door lock which is based on Knock Pattern.

## Hardware
- Arduino
- Piezosensor
- Servo
- LCD screen
- Plastic case
- Push button Switch
- Wires and resistances
- Batteries (9 V)

## Details
A piezosensor is mounted on the door. This senses the knocks and using this information, the Arduino records the intervals between the knocks and stores a knock pattern password.
The Arduino, servo (attached with the latch), LCD screen and circuit are enclosed in the plastic case.
The LCD screen displays appropriate messages to enable interaction with the user.
When a person knocks on the door, his/her knock pattern is compared with the preset knock password using Arduino.
If the personâ€™s knock password matches the preset, the servo rotates and the latch opens.

## Special features
1. The Arduino is programmed such that the tempo of the knocks can be varied.
2. The password can be reset and another knock pattern can be recorded as the preset.
3. In case required, a push switch is present which can reset the system and the original set knock password is considered as the preset.
