## Details
The project was inspired by Segways, and to control it using Bluetooth. The battery being used is 7.4V LiPo but the motors need 11.1V in order to perform at the maximum capacity. The values of the constants for PID algorithm make it stable by calculating and adjusting the input 30 times a second.
