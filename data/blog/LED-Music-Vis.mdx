## Aim
To make a LED Music Visualizer for Demonstration in ATMOS’14 Techtainment Event.
<!--more-->
## Hardware involved
1. LM324 – Op-Amp.
2. 74HC595 – 8 bit shift register (74HC164 a cheaper can also be used) X 8.
3. An Arduino.
4. And a couple of Capacitors and Resistors.

## Technical details

The 8*8 led matrix reacts by reading the 8 bit analog value from ADC pin of a clone Arduino and the 2-D LED matrix can be made to dance on the beats. There is no frequency distinguishing done on the incoming signal.
An array of 8- 8 bit shift registers were made to make a 64 bit 2-D LED display(8*8). Serial in-parellel out shift registers were used all provided with 500 Hz clock from an Arduino pin through code and serially pushing the data in.
All the registers were provided same data and clock pins and 8 different latch pins.(only one latch pin can be used to control all of the LEDs, but to shift for fast movement of pattern they shifted to 8 different latch pin design.

## Disadvantage or Drawback
Each design had to be encoded to show as a pattern on the Matrix, hence to change the pattern the code had to be changed a lot.
