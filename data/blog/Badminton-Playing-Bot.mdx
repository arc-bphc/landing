There were two Bots actually and were meant to play badminton’s doubles game. The highlight of this game were how the two robots hit and hit back shuttle by collaborating each other.The National ABU Robocon 2015 took place in the Badminton Hall of the Shree Shiv Chhatrapati Sports Complex, Balewadi, Pune on 7 March 2015.

BITS Pilani, Hyderabad campus participated first time in the competition with team leader Jayanth Kankipati and the faculty advisor YVD Rao sir. The team was sponsored by India Bank.Overall it was a good and a new experience. Both of our bots were working good, but we couldn’t win it.

Several Servo Motors were used for the arm Mechanism and for hitting Pneumatics were used at 6 bar pressure.The gas was packed in PET containers. The bot was controlled by dummy arm Mechanism.
