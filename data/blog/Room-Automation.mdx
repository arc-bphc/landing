### How to connect your setup to the switch board:-

1. Go and find the MCB of your room. You will find a MCB Board in your corridor.
2. Turn the MCB off for your room only.
3. Open your Switch Board.
4. Look for a wire which is common to all the switches. The above found wire is LIVE  wire {Be cautious of it , Never touch it directly)
5. Extend this wire and feed it to all COMs of your Relay Board.
6. You will find the wire for tubelight connected to the other side of switch. Connect this wire to NO pin of any of the relays.
7. Connect other wires(From Fan/Lamp/Tubelight) to different Relays .
8. Pack your Switch Board.

## Precautions
- Donâ€™t mess with the AC current.
- Use High quality wires for AC current.
