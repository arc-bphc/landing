## Aim
To make an autonomous robot which can respond to sound/claps.


## Hardware used
-   1 – Arduino Uno
-   2 – Analog sound sensors (one on each side of the bot).
-   2 – 100 rpm geared motors.
-   1 – L293D H-bridge motor driver.
-   1– Regular sized castor wheel for support.
-   1 – External 9v power supply for Arduino as well as motors.

## Details
The bot works on the fact that when sound is in a certain direction, the sensor closer to it measures a higher change in value (of amplitude/intensity) than the sensor away from it due to sound attenuation i.e. if the sound is to the right of the bot, the right sensor detects a higher change in sound intensity than the left sensor. Hence it moves to the right according to the code.
