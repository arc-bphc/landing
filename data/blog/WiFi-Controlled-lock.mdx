## Details
The lock consists of the above mentioned hardware. The ESP hosts a webpage on the local network hosted by router. The ESP can be programmed to connect to the router and then it gives an IP which when typed into the browser of any device on the same network, provides the graphical user interface for the control of the lock. The ESP triggers its pin and the Arduino controls the Linear Actuator accordingly.
