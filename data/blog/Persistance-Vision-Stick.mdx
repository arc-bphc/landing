## Aim
To make a POV Display.

## Hardware Used
- 8 – Green Colored LEDs.
- 1 – Serial in- Parallel out shift register.
- 1 – Digital InfraRed Sensor.
- 1 – Motor (rpm = 1000).
- 1 – On-board 5v power supply.
- 1 – Arduino

## Working
The LED to be glown in a frame was sent as data using SPI comm protocol
using slave select pin as the latch, and utilizing only MOSI.
IR sensor was used to detect the position of completion of one revolution.
By changing the delay ‘d’ in given code the width of characters can be changed.
Current Status:- Completed.
