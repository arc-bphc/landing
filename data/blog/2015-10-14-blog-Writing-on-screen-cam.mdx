## Aim
To convert 3D text to 2D writing , that is, when something is written in air it is displayed on the screen of computer.
<!--more-->
## Hardware
Laptop (preferably i3 or higher and any other computer of same efficiency for the execution to run smoothly).

## Details
The project was taken as an initiative for TechTainement of ATMOS- 2015.

## Software
You will be needing opencv and python 2.7.5 for this project.

## Advice from makers
It is preferred that the user writes with appropriate speed based on the processing speed. We can decrease the delay till 3ms for nice laptops, but in case of poor laptops , no matter how much delay is decreased per frame. Even though the delay was 4ms in this case, it still took 15ms delay.
