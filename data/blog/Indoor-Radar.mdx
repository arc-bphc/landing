## Details
A Ultrasonic distance sensor is mounted over a servo, that keeps rotating. The distances in different directions are recorded and the value of angle and distance is sent to the computer.

In the computer a cpp code shows a image that is manipulated according to the data recieved from the controller. Black dots will be put up for the objects traced as close as 50 cm or less.
