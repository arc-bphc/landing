## WORKING
This Robot Uses 3 Ultrasound Sensors(Left(l),Right(r),Center(c)).The Robot first moves forward.If the distance measured between any of the sensors and a wall is less than 12 cm then it means that a wall is found(sensor is active) and this has to followed. The robot responds in the way that is given in the table below.

SENSOR ACTIVE |                RESPONSE|
--------------|------------------------
c only     |              Turn right or left
r only     |              Move Forward
l only    |                Move forward
l and r     |             Move forward
l and c    |          Turn Right
r and c        |         Turn Left
all sensors   |      Turn 180 degree and Reverse.
No Sensor   |        Move forward

(before a wall is found)

9.No Sensor           STOP ,Turn Right Search for a wall,if not found come back to initial position,Then Turn Left And Search for a wall and start following it as soon as it is found.

(After A wall is found)

It is also made sure that the wall follower lies at a distance range of 3-10 cms from the wall According to the following table.

SENSOR ACTIVE |     DISTANCE FROM WALL |     RESPONSE
--------------|------------------------|--------------
Left           |                less than 3          |                      Turn Right
Left           |               greater than 10         |               Turn Left
Right          |              less than 3              |                  Turn Left
Right          |              greater than 10            |           Turn Right

This will be helpful in case of walls which are not straight,round walls.It can even avoid obstacles of any shape.

The Robot Cannot Turn 90degree Perfectly near turnings  so there is a high chance it may  either collide with the wall or deviate slant wards.The above arrangement removes these difficulties.
