## Aim
To make a dustbin that will open when you hover your hand over it.


## Requirements
- Arduino Uno
- HC-SR04 Ultrasound Sensor
- Servo motor (operating voltage: 6V DC , torque: 3.5 Kg.cm)
- Battery (12V 3AH)
- Jumper Cables
- A foot pedal Dustbin
- Breadboard
 

## Details
The ultrasound sensor is connected to the front of the dustbin and the servo is attached to a lever in the back which is a part of the foot pedal mechanism. A code is uploaded into the arduino which is used to accept inputs from the ultrasound sensor and direct the movements of the servo. The arduino is powered by the battery.

Hence the dustbin is opened using the servo when an object hovers over it and is similarly closed when the object is removed.
