## Aim 
To make a seismograph that detects vibrations of ground and plots a graph accordingly.
<!--more-->

## Hardware used
- Arduino Uno
- Operational Amplifier
- Magnet wire(copper)
- Neodymium magnets
- Springs and metal rods

## Details
The project is based upon a fundamental principle of physics: Faradaysâ€™s law of electromagnetic induction. The design consists of two metal bars with magnets attached at their ends and held stationary using springs. The bars are positioned such that the magnet hangs close to the coil. The mechanical design is such that when ground shakes, magnet moves with respect to coils, thereby inducing an alternating EMF. This EMF is then recorded and a time graph is plotted accordingly.
