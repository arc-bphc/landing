## Aim
To build a manually controlled Robot which can pick and drop (at desired location) Table Tennis balls.


## Hardware Used
- Arduino Nano.
- breadboard.
- 12V battery supply.
- 4-wheel chassis.
- Buck Convertor
- 100 rpm motors and wheels.
- castor wheel
- HC-05 bluetooth module.
- Micro servo
- MG995(Metal gear servo)
- L298 Motor Driver IC
- Mechanix Kit.

## Software used
Arduino IDE (you have to install CH-340 driver for  arduino nano) & control Joy stick app (available on play store) for Bluetooth Module.

## Working 
The working of the bot is simple it picks up the ball and place/drop the ball at desired location. Full mechanical design of the Bot is made using Mechanix Spares.

To lift the arm Four-Bar mechanism is used and bot is controlled via bluetooth.
